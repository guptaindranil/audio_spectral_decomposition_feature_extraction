# Feature Extraction using Audio Spectral Decompostion
Spectral decomposition, also referred to as spectral analysis, is a method employed to decompose a signal into its constituent frequencies. This process can be likened to decomposing a complex color into its basic color components. In the realm of audio signals, spectral decomposition provides us with the ability to understand and manipulate the different frequency components that constitute a sound.

This project is centered around the spectral decomposition of audio signals. Our objective is to delve deeper into the complexities of how sounds can be deconstructed into their fundamental frequencies, and how this knowledge can be harnessed in various audio signal processing applications.

In the course of this project, we will explore various methods of spectral decomposition, such as Fourier Transform, Short-Time Fourier Transform, and time-domain analysis. Each of these methods offers unique advantages and comes with its own set of limitations. We will discuss these methods in detail, providing a comparative analysis that will aid in understanding when to use which method.

Furthermore, we will demonstrate the practical application of these methods through real-world examples. This will not only provide a hands-on experience but also help in understanding the theoretical concepts in a practical setting.

The attributes to be extracted play a vital role when using it as a data set. Hence careful consideration has been taken to select the basic attributes that can then be used to classify higher-order audio characteristics.
The features extracted here are-
+ Amplitude Envelope
+ Root Mean Square Energy
+ Zero Crossing Rate
+ Fourier Transform
+ Spectogram
